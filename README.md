# Personal Organizer for ADHDers

_A project by [Julio Kock](https://juliokock.com)_  

A lightweight, opinionated setup to centralize day-to-day tools (notes, quick links, calculators) and keep experiments tidy — built to reduce friction and context switching.  

> This repo currently includes a React front-end (`react-page/`) and a minimal HTML prototype.

---

## 🔎 Why
- Minimize decision fatigue with a single “home” for work sessions.
- Keep small experiments discoverable instead of scattered folders.
- Provide a few pragmatic utilities (e.g., **ROAS Calculator**) used in a performance marketing workflow.

---

## ✨ Features (initial)
- **ROAS Calculator** page (React + Chakra UI).
- Simple **Projects** section to pin what matters now.
- Clean structure for growing modules without bloat.

Planned:
- Session launcher (deep links / apps / docs).
- Focus mode (layout + shortcuts).
- Optional cloud sync for quick notes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — React app
```bash
cd react-page
npm install
# If Create React App:
npm start
# If Vite:
# npm run dev
